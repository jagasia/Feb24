class Employee
{
	int employeeId;			//why public / private is not mentioned. In that case, it is default scope
					//means, it is accessible only within the same package
					//call it as package scope
}

Class is a blueprint for creating objects.	
We create a class. We create many objects for that class.

Employee is a class

Employee raja=new Employee();			//one object of Employee class
Employee siva=new Employee();			//another object of Employee class

A football game.

we need to define the game as objects interacting with other object

Player
Ball
Goal post
Ground

when i define Player object, there may be 11 instance of Players.

class Player

Player ronaldo=new Player();

objects have 
	identity			id, name, role, jerseyNo, dateOfBirth
	behavior			run, block, kickBall

customer purchase product

cid, pid, date, qty

information related to that object
	data members
behavior 
	methods


-----------------
Access modifiers
Methods
exit from a method
return value/ref from a method

static block	initialization blocks
static variable
static method


Field encapsulation, accessor and mutator
when you declare variables as non public in a class. You are encapsulating those variables from external world.
To allow access to the non public data members of a class, we use
	Accessors		getter methods
	Mutators		setter methods


Overloading

Constructors
Constructor overloading
Initial state initializers
chaining constructors		constructor order



//		Employee emp=new Employee();		//the same can be done in 2 steps as below:
		Employee emp;			//emp is a stack variable. if you see what is inside this variable, a null is found. It is a null pointer. No heeap is allocated at this stage.
		emp=new Employee();		//new Employee() is an object created in Heap. Its reference is kept in emp (stack variable)

emp is a reference variable. 

Access specifiers truth table:

		Same class	diff class of Same package	(Sub class Any package)	Anywhere	
private		YES		NO					NO		NO
default		YES		YES					NO		NO
protected	YES		YES					YES		NO
public		YES		YES					YES		YES


protected	=	default	+ sub class of any package

Methods:
	What is a method in java?		It is similar to functions in C, C++, Java script.
	We cannot write executable code directly in a class

class Employee
{
	int employeeId=1*2;			//1*2 is an executable code.
}

Only inside a method, we can write executable code.
methods provide modularity for the program.
reusability


public class Main2 {

	{	//this is called as instance block. instance=object
		System.out.println("Hello world");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Main2 m2=new Main2();
		System.out.println("India");
	}

}

When we create instance of a class, the instance blocks are executed.

--------------------------
package mphasis;

public class Main2 {

	{	//this is called as instance block. instance=object
		System.out.println("instance block");
	}
	
	static
	{
		System.out.println("This is static block");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Main2 m2=new Main2();
		System.out.println("India");
	}

}

......
static block is executed first
so the output is:-

This is static block
instance block
India

============
package mphasis;

public class Main2 {

	{	//this is called as instance block. instance=object
		System.out.println("instance block");
	}
	
	static
	{
		System.out.println("This is static block");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
//		Main2 m2=new Main2();
		System.out.println("India");
	}

}
for this the output will be

This is static block
India


Because, static block is executed, even if any object is not created for the class

what is static?
	does not belong to any object of the class


In java, 
	we cannot create static variable inside a method



static block
static variable
static method



package mphasis;

public class Student {
	private int studentId;		
	private String name;			//name is instance variable
	static String collegeName;		//collegeName is static variable
}



		Student.collegeName="LPU";	//allowed? why?	static member is accessible without object
		Student.name="Akshar";		//not allowed? why?



collegeName is static. It belongs to the class. Not to any object
name is not static. THat means it is instance variable

int sum(int i, int j)
{
	return i+j;
}


int result=sum(2,3);			will return 5


Double.parseDouble(String)		converts String into double
Double.valueOf(String)			converts String into Double



----------------
Overloading
	public int sum(int i, int j)
	{
		return i+j;
	}
	public float sum(float i, float j)
	{
		return i+j;
	}

same name but different signature.
This is called as overloading

Rules for overloading?
1) the parameters can be different data types
2) number of parameters can be different
3) order of data type of parameters can be different

The return type can be same or different.

-------------the above code is constructor chaining


What is inheritance?
	We create a class from existing class.
	We dont need to create a class from the scratch.
	A sub class derives 
		properties
		methods
	from the super class

	When should we do inheritance?
		Only when the sub class has "kind of" relationship with the super class.
		
	class Student
	{
		Address address;			//Address is another class
	}

	can we do this in inheritence way?

	class Student extends Address
	{
	}

	No. Because, Student is not a kind of Address

	Student has Address. "has" relationship (also called as "part of") can be represented as 
	class Student
	{
		Address address;			//Address is another class
	}


	class JavaStudent extends Student
	{}

	here, JavaStudent is a kind of Student. So inheritance is done

	When we create an object of JavaStudent, we are also creating an object of Student

	JavaStudent rama=new JavaStudent();
	rama is a JavaStudent.
	rama is also a Student

	So When we create an object of JavaStudent, we are also creating an object of Student

	"extends" to do inheritance


Task:
--------
Create a "Furniture" class 
	name, color 	(both are String)

methods;
	acceptDetails()				accept input for name and color
	displayDetails()			display name and color

Create a "Chair" class that inherits Furniture class
	noOfLegs	(int)

Create a "BookShelf" class that inherits Furniture class
	noOfShelves	(int)

Override the acceptDetails() and displayDetails() methods in both the sub classes

create a Main class and main method
	allow the user to choose 
		1: Chair
		2: Book Shelf

call the methods in main method


A class has some data members
	some times they are value types
	some times they are reference type

	They are called as dependencies

we can inject the dependencies via:
	constructor
	setters

When an employee joins organisation. THey may produce all documents initially or later.

Sometimes, you create object and then inject the dependencies using setter methods
Sometimes, you have all dependencies readily available so that you can inject them during construction itself


------------------------------------

Creating a singleton class
	What is a singleton class?
	A class that has only 1 object

Ex:		Runtime


To create a singleton class, we first should restrict users from creating an object.
make the constructor as private. Users cannot create an object of the class.


static methods cannot access instance variables. Because, we can call static method, even before creating any instance. vice versa is possible




Extends is used? because, by inheritance, we want to extend the functionality defined in the super class
Overriding

Rules for overriding:
1) Overriding method (sub class method) should not be less accessible
	if super class method is public, then sub class method cannot be anything lesser than public
	private	< default < protected < public

	ie., the overriding method, cannot reduce the visibility

2) the sub class method (overriding method) must match in signature and return type
3) the overriding method, cannot throw new exceptions


To verify all these rules, we can use @Override annotation

---------Dynamic polymorphism-----------------

Employee raja;
raja=new Programmer();
raja=new Developer();
raja=new ProjectManager();
raja=new Director();

-------------------------------------
Task:
------

abstract class Shape
{
	private String name;
	private String borderColor;
	private String fillColor;

	//why should we write a dummy method in Shape??????
	public abstract void calculateArea();			//notice that there is no body
}


public class Rectange extends Shape{
	public void calculateArea()
	{
		System.out.println("Rectange area is calculated using length * breadth");
	}
}



public class Triangle extends Shape {

	public void calculateArea()
	{
		System.out.println("Triangle area is 1/2*breadth*height");
	}
}


what is the need for abstract method?
	the formula is different for different shapes. So i cannot write a formula in Shape class. But in order to make this method available in sub classes, i need to define.

An abstract class forces the sub classes to override all the abstract methods present.


-----------------
Final class is final in the hierarchy of inheritance
So a class cannot inherit a final class.

what about final method???
a final method cannot be overridden.

If a class is final, then there is no sub class for that class. So no need to mention final in methods. 
There is no sub class means, there is no overriding

-------------
what is final variable?		Yesterday i told TRUE LIE
final int i=20;				means i is constant

in java, constants are FULL CAPS

so
final int MARKS=20;			MARKS is full capital because it is final

so you understand 
	final class
	final method
	final variable


-------------
Order of constructors
	Super class constructor is invoked before the sub class constructor
	Because, basically an object of super class is created first




i want to learn java.
	can you tell me what are the chapters you are covering in your course?

	1. llll
	2. lkjlkdjfkds
	3. lajsdflkjsdfksdf
	4. popujoisadfsdfsdf
	5. a;lskdjfsdkjf


Only the name of the chapters. Not the content of the chapters

They will even give you the pamplet that contains chapter names to take away
They will not give you the book to take away

Interface is just the declaration of methods present in the original class


every method in an interface is public ONLY. 		even if you do not specifiy public also
every data member in an interface is 
		public static final			ONLY

an interface can contain NO VARIABLE. BUT only CONSTANTS


interface Person
{
	int age=20;		//NOTE value must be provided
	void speak();	//there is no body		i didnt use "abstract" here but it is 
}

class Student implements Person
{
	public void speak()			//error because, overriding method cannot be less accessible
	{
		System.out.println("Student speaks");
	}	
}




In java 8

an interface METHOD can contain body if:
	the method is static
	the method is declared as default






-------------------------------


interface A
{
	static void display()
	{
		System.out.println("Display method of interface A is called");
	}
	default void speak()
	{
		System.out.println("Interface A speaks");
	}
}

class Aimpl implements A
{
	public void display()
	{
		System.out.println("THis is A display");
	}
	public void speak()
	{		
		System.out.println("My way high way");
	}
}

public class Main4 {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Aimpl a=new Aimpl();
		a.display();
		a.speak();
	}

}

---------------------------------
Types of interfaces:
	1) Marker Interface
	2) Functional Interface

Marker:
-------
	A interface that does not have any abstract methods, is called as Marker interface
	This is used for type inference

ex:
	Serializable			(is a marker interface, because, it does not have any abstract methods)
	
	class A implements Serializable

	A a=new A();		//object of A that implements Serializable interface
	a instanceof Serializable		returns true




Serializable []arr=new Serializable[10];
	arr[0]=new A();
	arr[1]=new B();
	arr[2]=new A();


Functional Interface:
-------------------
An interface that has only 1 abstract method is called as Functional Interface

ex:
	Runnable	interface contains only run() method

Why functional interface is significant?
	Functional interfaces can be implemented using lambda

the implementation of a functional interface can be done in :
1)
		MyInterface x=new MyInterfaceImpl();
		x.doThis();
-----------
2)
//		MyInterface x=new MyInterface() {
//			
//			@Override
//			public void doThis() {
//				System.out.println("Hi world");
//				
//			}
//		};
//		x.doThis();

------------------
3)
		MyInterface x=()->{
			System.out.println("Hi this is my lambda implementation");
		};
		x.doThis();
---------------------



How to  reverse a String?
1) StringBuilder or StringBuffer
	has a method called reverse

2) String class has charAt(index) method
	loop the characters from last element to index 0


How to reverse the words like
	I Love India
	India Love I

answ:
	Split the string by "space". You will get array of strings
	loop from last element of the array to first element of the array

-------------------------------------------------------

in C language
	int x=0;
	if(x)
		puts("100");
	else
		puts("500");			//500 is the answer

in C language,
	0 is considered as false. Any non 0 is true

But in Java
	int x=0;
	if(x)				this is not allowed

But in Java
	boolean x=false;
	if(x)				this is ALLOWED

	
----------------------------------

Strings
	there is no null terminator \0	at the end of a string like c, c++ language
	we use "" for strings
	
	String is immutable. Immutable means, we cannot change
	

	String str="hello";		here we have created an object
	str="world";			here we have created another object whose reference is stored in str
	
	a new object of String is created whenever you assign a new value;

	"world" 	this itself is an object
	"hello"		this itself is an object
	
	str="20";
			a string literal is an object

	so what? i am able to change. so i am comfortable with String. no issues.....

	str=" A very large paragraph of hundreds of line like we type in a notepad";

Updating a string like
	insert in between
	replace
	delete some of the characters
	
	those operations cannot be performed in String object.

This is where, we understand that there is a need for
	StringBuilder
	StringBuffer

Both StringBuilder and StringBuffer classes have same set of properties and methods

Then what is the only difference between these 2 classes?????
StringBuffer is synchronized			StringBuilder is not synchronized

What is meant by synchronized?
	when multiple threads access an object simultaneously at a time, only 1 thread is allowed to access. Other threads are made to wait.

This is also called as thread safe.

Since StringBuffer provided thread lock, it is slow.
StringBuilder is fast. But not thread safe. So in single threaded processes, StringBuilder is preferred.

Lets see some of the StringBuilder methods

toString()		returns the string inside the string builder
constructor()		accepts a string and appends it into the string builder
reverse()		reverses the string
append()		accepts a string as parameter and appends to the end of the existing string
insert()
replace()
delete()
setCharAt()
indexOf
lastIndexOf
equals


Task:
String str="There is a problem. And the problem is not clear. For every problem there is a solution";

Replace all the occurrance of "is" with "was".



------------------
An sms came like
"Please note the number 989898989 and call this number. if it is not working, call 67676767676. "
From this string, how to extract only numbers


		String str="Please note the number 989898989 and call this number. if it is not working, call 67676767676. ";
		//		[0-9]+		
		//		\\d+
		//		\\d{1,}
		//all the above expressions match with 1 or more digit numbers
		Pattern pattern=Pattern.compile("[0-9]+");
		Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(str);
		while(matcher.find())
			System.out.println(matcher.group());


----------------------------
Accept email address as input and validate if it is a valid email address or not

		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String email=sc.next();
		String pattern="[a-z]+([.][a-z]+)?[@][a-z]+[.](([a-z]{3})|([a-z]{2}[.][a-z]{2}))";
		if(email.matches(pattern))
			System.out.println("Valid");
		else
			System.out.println("Invalid");
